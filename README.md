Bounded, SPLIT [Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method) with [pseudo-transient continuation
](https://ctk.math.ncsu.edu/TALKS/Purdue.pdf) and [backtracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking_line_search)

Good for ill-conditioned problems where there are two different sets of systems

Particular applications include
* [Fast-Slow Reaction-Diffusion systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction%E2%80%93diffusion_system)
* [CFD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_fluid_dynamics) - Pressure-Velocity coupling

## What does 'split' mean?

The system is divided into multiple segments, and for ease of communication, letâ€™s refer to the first segment of variables as "outer" and the remaining as "inner".

* Holding the outer variables fixed, Newton iteration is performed recursively for the inner variables, using the sub-Jacobian associated with them, until convergence is reached.

* One Newton step is then performed for the outer variables, while the inner variables are kept fixed, using the sub-Jacobian for the outer subsystem.

* This process is repeated, alternating between solving the inner and outer subsystems, until the convergence criterion for the entire system (similar to standard Newton) is met.

### Example:

Consider a system of 5 variables, with the split locations at indices [1, 4]. This results in the following segments:

  * `a1` (variables from 0 to 1)
  * `a2 a3 a4` (variables from 1 to 4)
  * `a5` (variable at index 4)

1. First, the innermost segment `a5` is solved recursively using Newton's method while holding the variables `a1` and `a2 a3 a4`) fixed. This step is repeated until the convergence criterion for `a5` is met.

2. Next, one Newton step is taken for the segment `a2 a3 a4`, with `a5` held fixed. This step is followed by solving `a5` again till convergence.

3. This alternating process repeats: solving for `a5` until convergence, then one step for `a2 a3 a4`, and so on, until all subsystems converge.

Finally, one Newton step is performed for `a1`, with the other segments fixed. This completes one cycle of the split Newton process.

## How to install and execute?

Just run 
```
pip install splitnewton
```

There is an [examples](https://github.com/gpavanb1/SplitNewton/examples) folder that contains a test function and driver program

## How good is this?

Consider the test problem

$\lambda_{a} = 10^{6}$, 
$\lambda_{b} = 10^{2}$
with the second system,
$\lambda_{c} = 10^{-1}$
$\lambda_{d} = 10^{-4}$
and third system,
$\lambda_{c} = 10^{-6}$
$\lambda_{d} = 10^{-8}$

and using `logspace` for variation in $\lambda_{i}$


$$ F(u) = \lambda_{a} u^{4}_{1} + ... + \lambda_{b} u^{4}_{\lfloor N/3 \rfloor} + \lambda_{c} u^{4}_{\lceil N/3 \rceil} + ... + \lambda_{d} u^{4}_{\lfloor 2N/3 \rfloor} + \lambda_{e} u^{4}_{\lceil 2N/3 \rceil} + ... + \lambda_{f} u^{4}_{N}$$

$$
J(u) = 3 \times \begin{bmatrix}
\lambda_a & \dots & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & \dots & \lambda_b & 0 & \dots & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 \\
0 & \dots & 0 & \lambda_c & \dots & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & \dots & 0 & 0 & \dots & \lambda_d & 0 & \dots & 0 \\
0 & \dots & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & \lambda_e & \dots & 0 \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & \dots & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 0 & \dots & \lambda_f
\end{bmatrix} \cdot u^2
$$

For N=5000 (with no backtracking and pseudo-transient continuation), 

| Method    | Time       | Iterations    |
|-----------|------------|---------------|
| Split Newton    |    34 seconds |  33   |
| Newton |  not converged > 1 min  | NA  |

## How to test?
You can run tests with the `pytest` framework using `python -m pytest`

The coverage reports can be generated with `pytest-cov` plugin using `python -m pytest --cov=splitnewton`
